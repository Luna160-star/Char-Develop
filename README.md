<br><br>

<h2> Description </h2>
<br>
CharDevelop is a website which helps users in creating an initial character with a persona, they may need while writing a story.

<br><br>

<h2> Inspiration and Credit: </h2>
<br>
<li> My friend, she writes really good stories and she wanted something like this?
<li> Google, for meanings of word 'Framework'

<br><br>

<h2> How it fits the theme: </h2>
<br> Framework means "A organized structural plan or basis of a system." according to Merriam-Webster dictionary. And this website is basically a structured plan to create a character, build its persona step by step. <br>
Because it provides an organized structure for making a character. So,it fits the theme.
